Features
^^^^^^^^

* Written in C (C11)
* Platform independent, uses custom low-level layer for device drivers
* 1-Wire protocol fits UART specifications at ``9600`` and ``115200`` bauds
* Allows standard one-wire single-gpio manual control (when UARTs are no more available by the system)
* Hardware is responsible for timing characteristics
  * Allows DMA on the high-performance microcontrollers
* Different device drivers included
  * DS18B20 temperature sensor is natively supported
* Works with operating system due to hardware timing management
  * Separate thread-safe API is available
* API for device scan, reading and writing single bits
* User friendly MIT license

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* C compiler
* Platform dependent drivers
* Few *kB* of non-volatile memory
