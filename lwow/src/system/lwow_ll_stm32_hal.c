/*
 * How it works (general)
 *
 * https://docs.majerle.eu/projects/lwow/en/latest/user-manual/hw_connection.html#
 *
 * This specific driver is optimized for proejcts generated by STM32CubeMX or STM32CubeIDE with HAL drivers
 * It can be used w/ or w/o operating system and it uses interrupts & polling for data receive and data transmit.
 *
 * Application must pass pointer to UART handle as argument to ow_init function in order
 * to link OW instance with actual UART hardware used for OW instance.
 *
 * To use this driver, application must:
 * - Enable interrupt in CubeMX to allow HAL_UART_Receive_IT functionality
 * - Use pointer to UART handle when initializing ow with ow_init
